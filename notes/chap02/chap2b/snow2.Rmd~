Again, we use `makeCluster()` to create a cluster.
```{r}
library(snow)
hosts <- c('localhost', 'localhost', 'localhost', 'localhost')
cl <- makeCluster(hosts, type="SOCK")
```

### Functions and Environments

Parallel functions in snow typically take a function object as an argument called a worker function. The worker function is byte streamed by `serialize()` and converted to a copy with `unserlialize()`.

Unfortunately namespace environments are serialized by name, not by value. The global environment is also serialized by name. You may need to send variables to workers explicitly, e.g., by `clusterExport()`. You can also create a worker function by another function. But you need to be careful serializing large, unneeded objects.

```{r}
a <- 1:4
x <- rnorm(4)
clusterExport(cl, "x")
mult <- function(s) s * x
parLapply(cl, a, mult)
```
The function `mult()` is defined at the top level, so its environment is the global environment. `x` is in the global environment and is not serlialzed and thus must be exported.

A more natural solution in this case would be to include `x` as an explicit argument to `mult()`, and then `parLapply()` would send it to the workers for us. However, using `clusterExport()` could be more efficient if we were going to reuse `x` by calling `mult()` many times with `parLapply()`.

```{r}
pmult <- function(cl) {
a <- 1:4
x <- rnorm(4)
mult <- function(s) s * x
parLapply(cl, a, mult)
}
pmult(cl)
```
Since `mult()` is created by `pmult()`, all of `pmult()`’s local variables will be accessible when `mult()` is executed by the cluster workers, including `x`.

But we need to make this more general. Pass `a` and `x` as arguments rather than hard code them.
```{r}
pmult <- function(cl, a, x) {
x # force x
mult <- function(s) s * x
parLapply(cl, a, mult)
}
scalars <- 1:4
dat <- rnorm(4)
pmult(cl, scalars, dat)
```
Since `x` is now an argument, we have to force its evaluation before calling `parLapply()`; otherwise, the workers will report that `dat` wasn’t found, since they don’t have access to the environment where `dat` is defined.

`cl` and `a` are serliazed, but are not needed. This would be a problem if `a` is  large. To prevent that, we can reset the environment of `mult()` to the global environment and pass `x` to `mult()` explicitly.
```{r}
pmult <- function(cl, a, x) {
  mult <- function(s, x) s * x
  environment(mult) <- .GlobalEnv
  parLapply(cl, a, mult, x)
}
scalars <- 1:4
dat <- rnorm(4)
pmult(cl, scalars, dat)
```

### Random Number Generation

`snow` is good for Monte Carlo simulations, bootstrapping, etc. that depend on random numbers. Workers must be seeded differently.

The R packages `rlecuyer` and `rsprng` do this, but must be installed on all workers.

Note: we do not have `rsprng` installed yet.

To use `rlecuyer`, set type to `RNGstream`:
```{r}
clusterSetupRNG(cl, type='RNGstream', seed=c(1,22,333,444,55,6))
unlist(clusterEvalQ(cl, rnorm(1)))
stopCluster(cl)
```
To use a random seed with `rlecuyer`, you’ll have to specify it explicitly using the `seed` argument, which is a vector of six integers.

Use the same `seed` to get reproducible results.

We can also get reproducible results using `clusterApply()`, but not with `clusterAp plyLB()` because `clusterApply()` always uses the same task scheduling.

### snow Configuration

Options for how the cluster is created can be specified as named arguments to the cluster creation function, e.g., `makeCluster()`, `makeSOCKcluster()`, `makeMPIcluster()`.
```{r}
library(snow)
hosts <- c('localhost', 'localhost', 'localhost', 'localhost')
cl <- makeCluster(hosts, type="SOCK")
setDefaultClusterOptions(outfile="")
stopCluster(cl)
Sys.info()[['nodename']]
Sys.info()[['sysname']]
Sys.info()[['user']]
cl <- makeCluster(hosts, type="SOCK", master=Sys.info()[['nodename']])
stopCluster(cl)
```
You can also use the `setDefaultClusterOptions()` function to change a default config- uration option during an R session. By default, the outfile option is set to `/dev/null`, which causes all worker output to be redirected to the null device. To prevent output from being redirected, you can change the default value of outfile to the empty string.

Table 2-1 lists the snow configuration options.

Workers can be configured differently, e.g., if their architectures are different, but it is tricky. Two mechanisms available for that with the socket transport.  
* Set the `homogeneous` option to `FALSE`, which causes snow to use a special startup script to launch the workers.  
* Call `makeSOCKcluster()` and specify the worker machines as a list of lists. In this case, the hostname of the worker is specified by the host element of each sublist.  
```{r}
library(snow)
workerlist <- list(list(host = "localhost"), list(host = "localhost", user = "jharner"))
cl <- makeSOCKcluster(workerlist)
clusterEvalQ(cl, Sys.info()[['user']])
stopCluster(cl)
```

### Installing Rmpi

Installing `Rmpi` can be problematic because it depends on MPI being previously installed. Also, there are multiple MPI distributions. Open MPI is the preferred MPI distribution.

On Ubuntu install Open MPI with `apt-get` since `apt-get` will automatically install a compatible version of MPI.

### Executing snow Programs on a cluster with Rmpi

Using the socket transport doesn’t require any additional software to install, making it the most portable `snow` transport. However, the MPI transport is probably the most popular, at least on clusters.

To create an MPI cluster object, set the `type` argument of `makeCluster()` to `MPI` or use the `makeMPIcluster()` function

Note: Using `makeMPIcluster(mpi.universe.size() - 1)` will not work since we do not have a true cluster, i.e., `mpi.universe.size()` is 1.

```{r}
library(snow)
library(Rmpi)
hosts <- c('localhost', 'localhost', 'localhost', 'localhost')
mpi.universe.size()
cl <- makeCluster(names=hosts, 4, type="MPI")
r <- clusterEvalQ(cl, R.version.string)
print(unlist(r))
stopCluster(cl)
```
This creates a spawned cluster, since the workers are all started by snow for you via the `mpi.comm.spawn()` function.

You can’t specify the machines on which to execute the workers with `makeMPIcluster()`. That is done with a separate program that comes with your MPI distribution. Open MPI comes with three utilities for executing MPI programs: `orterun`, `mpirun`, and `mpiexec`.

Use `orterun` to execute the R interpreter, which in turn executes the R script. For example, consider the `mpi.R` script:
```
library(snow)
library(Rmpi)
cl <- makeMPIcluster(mpi.universe.size() - 1)
r <- clusterEvalQ(cl, R.version.string)
print(unlist(r))
stopCluster(cl)
mpi.quit()
```

To execute `mpi.R` using the local machine as the master, and `n1`, `n2`, `n3` and `n4` as the workers, we can use the command:
```
% orterun -H localhost,n1,n2,n3,n4 -n 1 R --slave -f mpi.R
```

### Executing snow Programs with a Batch Queueing System

Many cluster administrators require that all parallel programs be executed via a batch queueing system. There are different ways that this can be done, and different batch queueing systems, but I will describe a method that has been commonly used for a long time, and is supported by many batch queueing systems, such as `PBS/TORQUE`.

You submit a shell script, and the shell script executes your R script using `orterun`.

### Troubleshooting snow Programs

When using the socket transport, the single most useful method of troubleshooting is *manual* mode. In manual mode, you start the workers yourself, rather than having snow start them for you. 

```{r}
# cl <- makeCluster(4, type="SOCK", manual=TRUE, outfile="")

# cl <- makeCluster(c('localhost', 'localhost', 'localhost', 'localhost'), type="SOCK",   manual=TRUE, outfile="")

# cl <- makeCluster(c('localhost'), type="SOCK")
# stopCluster(cl)
```

snow provides a useful variety of functions that support embarrassingly parallel computation. snow doesn’t provide functions for explicitly communicating between the master and workers, and in fact, the workers never communicate between themselves.
