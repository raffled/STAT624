Bootstrapping is often used as an example of easy parallelization, and some methods of producing confidence intervals require many thousands of bootstrap samples. As from version 1.3-1 the package itself has parallel support within its main functions, but we illustrate how to use the original (serial) functions in parallel computations.

We consider two examples using the cd4 dataset from package boot where the interest is in the correlation between before and after measurements. The first is a straight simulation, often called a parametric bootstrap. The non-parallel form is:
```{r}
library(boot)
cd4.rg <- function(data, mle) MASS::mvrnorm(nrow(data), mle$m, mle$v)
cd4.mle <- list(m = colMeans(cd4), v = var(cd4))
cd4.boot <- boot(cd4, corr, R = 999, sim = "parametric",
                 ran.gen = cd4.rg, mle = cd4.mle)
boot.ci(cd4.boot,  type = c("norm", "basic", "perc"),
        conf = 0.9, h = atanh, hinv = tanh)
```

To do this with `mclapply` we need to break this into separate runs, and we will illustrate two runs of 500 simulations each:
```{r}
library(parallel)
cd4.rg <- function(data, mle) MASS::mvrnorm(nrow(data), mle$m, mle$v)
cd4.mle <- list(m = colMeans(cd4), v = var(cd4))
run1 <- function(...) boot(cd4, corr, R = 500, sim = "parametric",
                           ran.gen = cd4.rg, mle = cd4.mle)
mc <- detectCores()
## To make this reproducible:
set.seed(123, "L'Ecuyer")
cd4.boot <- do.call(c, mclapply(seq_len(mc), run1) )
boot.ci(cd4.boot, type = c("norm", "basic", "perc"), conf = 0.9,
        h = atanh, hinv = tanh)
```

To run this with `parLapply` we could take a similar approach by:
```{r}
library(parallel)
library(boot)
run1 <- function(...) {
  library(boot)
  cd4.rg <- function(data, mle) MASS::mvrnorm(nrow(data), mle$m, mle$v)
  cd4.mle <- list(m = colMeans(cd4), v = var(cd4))
  boot(cd4, corr, R = 500, sim = "parametric",
       ran.gen = cd4.rg, mle = cd4.mle)
  }

cl <- makeCluster(mc)
## make this reproducible
clusterSetRNGStream(cl, 123)
cd4.boot <- do.call(c, parLapply(cl, seq_len(mc), run1) )
boot.ci(cd4.boot, type = c("norm", "basic", "perc"),
        conf = 0.9, h = atanh, hinv = tanh)
stopCluster(cl)
```

Note that whereas with `mclapply` all the packages and objects we use are automatically available on the workers, this is not in general the case with the `parLapply` approach. There is often a delicate choice of where to do the computations: for example we could compute `cd4.mle` on the workers (as above) or on the master and send the value to the workers. We illustrate the latter by the following code:
```{r}
cl <- makeCluster(mc)
cd4.rg <- function(data, mle) MASS::mvrnorm(nrow(data), mle$m, mle$v)
cd4.mle <- list(m = colMeans(cd4), v = var(cd4))
clusterExport(cl, c("cd4.rg", "cd4.mle"))
junk <- clusterEvalQ(cl, library(boot)) # discard result
clusterSetRNGStream(cl, 123)
res <- clusterEvalQ(cl, boot(cd4, corr, R = 500,
                             sim = "parametric", ran.gen = cd4.rg, mle = cd4.mle))
library(boot) # needed for c() method on master
cd4.boot <- do.call(c, res)
boot.ci(cd4.boot,  type = c("norm", "basic", "perc"), conf = 0.9,
        h = atanh, hinv = tanh)
stopCluster(cl)
```
